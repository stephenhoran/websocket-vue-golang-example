# websocket-vue-golang-example
This example application was created as a proof of concept to verify functionality between Go's websocket server, specific mux
and leveraging native websocket's in Vue and integration with Vuex. I found it difficult to find good examples of the two
specific technologies talking to each other. Hopefully these code examples will save someone else the time spent researching 
this subject. I will add comments to the code when I have some free time.

_Note: This is not idiomatic code, do not use in production..._

# Go
```
go run cmd/main.go
```


# Vue
